[Scott Hanselman ordered us all](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/your-words-are-wasted) to start blogging. Reading about best practices is insufficient; practices are meant to be practiced.

Granted, I'm hosting my blog for free on GitHub Pages, but we all have to start somewhere. I'll read the second half of Mr. Hanselman's post eventually.
